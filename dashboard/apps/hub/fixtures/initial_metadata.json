Results for 2008 can be found in xls format. There are also archived election results and statistics from 1938-1999. From 1936-1979, pdfs of the canvass summary are provided for both general and primary elections. And from 1980-1999, additional statistics on absentee counts and precinct/county data are available in pdf form for general elections. There is only data available for governor, senate, and house seats. Results for county auditor and sheriff are available for 2012 and 2008.\r\n\r\nLive Results\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\nThe live results page has an RSS feed and CSV file for federal, senate, house, and county results (broken down by county). Results on the live results site are considered unofficial. The files are found at http://electionresults.sos.iowa.gov/resultsMedia.aspx. Here is an example of a rss feed showing results from senate races by district: http://electionresults.sos.iowa.gov/resultsRSS.aspx?text=All&type=SEN&map=DIST. The equivalent file in CSV format is at http://electionresults.sos.iowa.gov/resultsCSV.aspx?text=All&type=SEN&map=DIST.\r\n\r\nOfficial Results\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\nThe official results pages contain statistics on voter turnout, absentee ballots (for some years), results for individual races and, in recent years, an Excel file with precinct-level data for all races ([example from 2010](http://sos.iowa.gov/elections/results/xls/2010/general/statewidepct.xlsx)) for primary and general elections. The individual race result pages can be found in xls format (example: http://sos.iowa.gov/elections/results/xls/2010/primary/Johnson.xls) from 2006 and later. Results priof to 2004 are found in pdf format. Special elections results also include turnout reports and precinct results by county (in pdf form).",
